So you're done reading the [How]({{ site.url }}/how/) and you're ready to make your
very own GDG Garage official? <span class="c1">Fantastic!</span> Here's
what you need to do:

1. <span class="c2">Nothing.</span>
  * Seriously, if you just want to start, you don't need to tell us
    or anyone else. Go ahead and have your first meeting!
  * Go back to the [How]({{ site.url }}/how/) to get some ideas on how
    to get started.
  * Erm, why are you still reading this?

But let's say you want to get the <span class="c3">benefits</span> of
being listed here on this site. Maybe you want to join the <span
class="c4">global community</span> of GDG Garagists. If so, please fill [the form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1Q_oTlubKK12geWENsNXs4q3GvES2W4gmG9lQ1eMRJ_k/viewform) below.
